	 *   pc2
	 * 	   operations: [read]
	 * 	   paths:
	 * 	     u1-ua2-oa2-o1 ops=[read]
	 *   pc1
	 * 	   operations: [read, write]
	 * 	   paths:
	 * 	     u1-ua1-oa1-o1 ops=[read, write]
	 *
	 * @param user the user
	 * @param target the target
	 * @return an Explain object containing the details of the user's access on the target.
	 * @throws PMException if there is an error traversing the graph to determine the paths.
